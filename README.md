## Description

I used a rapid api currency exchanger api. and a simple cart so you know how much money you need for a item in market

## Getting Started

first choose your steam currency then add your balance by clicking on it.then just add the items you want to buy on the left side and items you want to sell on right side. i also added tf2 to be simple (you need to bypass cors to use it).

### Dependencies

- using rapid api currency exchange api [here](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange)
- react ofc
- you also need to bypass cors on your browser to get access to steam api(I recommend a extention)

### Executing program

- clone the project and run npm install

### Known issues

- Endpoint steamcommunity.com is blocked by CORS and it should be hanlded from server side. (just turn off your brwosers CORS and it will be okey)
